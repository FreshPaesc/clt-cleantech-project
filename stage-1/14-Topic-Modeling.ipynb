    "In the media dataset much of the topics are separated along geopolitical dimensions like large projects in certain countries/continents (e.g. Africa, China, Saudi-Arabia), sanctions due to the Russia-Ukraine war, etc. Also many topics are dominated by technologies or ressources which are clearly not considered \"clean\" like oil and gas. But as these are part of the motivation and maybe reasons for cleaner technologies they seem to appear hear as media is reporting in a broader societal/political context.\n",
