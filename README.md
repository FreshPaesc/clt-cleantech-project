# Cleantech Insights Project

## Overview
We focus on gaining insights into the **latest developments** in the **cleantech sector** by analyzing **media and patent publications** using various computer language techniques. This project is conducted as part of the  Computer Language Technologies module (FS24) at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Lucerne. 

## Datasets
we make use of the following datasets in our project:

- <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharbhandari20/cleantech-google-patent-dataset>
- <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jannalipenkova/cleantech-media-dataset>

## Setup
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
    On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Download the datasets and place them in the `data/`-folder.


## Compatibility
This project is created and developed with Python `3.9.13`. 

## Colab Usage
For using this project in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the `setup_colab.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook cells to download necessary data.
3. Start analyzing the cleantech insights in the Colab environment.
